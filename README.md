2. **Approval Webhook**: Handles document upload and email notifications
3. **Success Webhook**: Processes successfully signed documents
4. **Declined Webhook**: Manages declined document scenarios

For testing webhook integrations, you can use [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/post) as a callback URL endpoint.
