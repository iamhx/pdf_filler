# PDF Filler User Guide

This guide provides information on how to use the PDF Filler application for document approval workflows.

## Overview

PDF Filler is a web application that allows users to sign or decline document pairs as part of an approval workflow. The system handles two types of documents:

1. **Original Document**: The final document with all changes accepted
2. **Document Amendment Record (DAR)**: Document showing tracked changes/revisions

## Workflow Process

### For Approvers

1. You will receive an email with links to view and sign documents
2. Click the link to open the document in your browser
3. Review the documents carefully
4. Choose to either:
   - Sign both documents (approve)
   - Decline the approval request
5. Once you make a decision, the system will notify the workflow initiator

### Key Features

- **Modal Error Messages**: If a document has already been signed or is no longer available, a clear error modal will appear
- **Session-Based**: All your actions are tracked within a secure session
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Documents and sessions are automatically removed after completion or expiration

## Common Questions

### What happens if I close my browser before signing?

Your session remains active until it expires (typically 24 hours). You can return using the same link to complete the signing process.

### Can I sign just one document and decline the other?

No. Both documents must be either signed or declined together. If you sign one document and then decline the other, the entire session will be marked as declined.

### What if the link in my email doesn't work?

The link may have expired or the session may have been completed by another approver. Contact the workflow initiator to request a new approval link if needed.

### Can I download the documents for review before signing?

No, you cannot download the documents directly from the PDF Filler application. You can view the documents within the application's interface. If you need downloadable copies for review, these will be attached to the email you receive with the signing links.
